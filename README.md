My first readme

Today, I learned new git command:
> The basics: 
> > - git add
> > - git commit.
> > - git push.
> * These two added to git add form the very basic (but very important).

Later, I used some of the unix command:
> - echo: for writing to a file.
> - touch: for creating a file.
> - sed (stream editor): for editing and replacing a string with another from a file from the command line.

I look at more advanced git command:
> - git checkout: to switch from one branch to another
> - git branch: to create branches locally and later put to github
> - git rm: to remove a file from my local system.
> - git push: to push local version of my code to github.
